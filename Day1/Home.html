          Deciding on the right layout is one of the first steps in website
          design. Serving as the foundations of your site, a website layout can
          greatly impact how communicative and intuitive you are online.

          <br />
          From asymmetrical designs to classic patterns and split screens, this
          article includes 10 website layout ideas that will help you get it
          right the first time when figuring out how to build your website.

          <h2>What is a website layout?</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            A website layout is the arrangement of all visual elements on a
            webpage. Through the intentional positioning of page elements, we
            can control the relationship between them to better guide the user
            experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Acting as a key component of web design, a layout determines the
            sequence in which page elements are registered among visitors, which
            elements draw the most attention, and the visual overall balance of
            the site. Because of its visual significance, a website layout can
            enhance a website’s message and usability.
          </p>

          <p>
            Did you know that nearly all first impressions—94%, to be exact—are
            shaped by a website’s design? This just goes to show how much your
            layout influences how visitors perceive and interact with your site.
            Put plainly, a good website layout can lead visitors’ focus in the
            right direction—gravitating them toward what matters most first, and
            then continue to the following sections in order of significance. A
            layout can also be used to enhance your design, create interesting
            interactions and show that you’re up-to-date with web design trends.

        <h2>How to choose the right website layout</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          When approaching the task of choosing a website layout, there are two
          main factors to take into account.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Accommodate your content</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The layout you choose should be fitting for your type of content. Why?
          A website layout needs to help tell the story you wish to deliver to
          visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          "[Observe] the balance of text versus images on any given page,"
          writes Wix Template Designer Kobi Michaeli in his guide for selecting
          the right layout. "Some homepage designs are very design-heavy.
          They’re only meant to include a few lines of text next to a large,
          full-scale image. Forcing more text into these areas could throw off
          the balance of the whole page if you’re not careful.
        </p>

        <p>
          "As another example, let’s say you’re working with a template that has
          big text blocks and proportionately small images. If you end up
          writing minimal content or adding large images in spaces better suited
          for icons, then things can start looking awkward."
        </p>

        <p>
          Some types of website layouts are best used for showcasing products or
          works, making them more suitable for an eCommerce website or portfolio
          websites. Others convey factual information quickly and efficiently,
          and might work better for creating a blog or news platform.
        </p>

        <div class="content2">
          <h2>Use common layouts</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            While there’s room for creativity, the most well-known,
            tried-and-tested website layouts are usually the best option. These
            classic layouts tend to feel familiar to users, as they build on
            existing expectations, past experiences and the principles of
            design.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's also worth considering some more general and commonly respected
            design principles. Gestalt psychology is often applied to website
            design and is especially relevant when it comes to the design of
            website layouts. This is because how elements are grouped, in order
            to create a positive user experience, lies at the heart of Gestalt
            theory. The main principles are:
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Proximity</span>: Elements that belong together, such as menu
            and navigation bar, should be grouped together for usability.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Similarity</span>: Elements that look the same and behave the
            same should also be positioned together.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Continuity</span>: This focuses on providing an easy flow for
            users through a webpage through continuity between elements. One way
            to do this could by implementing pagination.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Closure</span>: This means users are not left with nowhere to
            go, or without another element to lead them through a page.
            Overlapping images are a good example of closure applied to a
            website layout.
          </p>

            You might also want to consider applying the rule of thirds to your
            website layout. This a fundamental principle in photography and
            visual composition. It suggests dividing an image into a grid of
            nine equal parts by drawing two equally spaced horizontal lines and
            two equally spaced vertical lines, resulting in four intersecting
            points. It encourages designers to place key elements of interest
            along these lines or at the points of intersection. The idea is that
            by doing so, the composition becomes more visually appealing and
            balanced, as it avoids placing the subject or important elements
            directly in the center of the frame.
          </p>
